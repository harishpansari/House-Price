# House Price Prediction
Data Used: Melbourne Housing Data


# Average Sales Price: 
This metric provides an average of property sale prices in a specific area over a period of time. It helps assess market trends and property values.

# Days on Market (DOM): 
DOM measures the number of days a property is listed for sale before it is sold. A lower DOM may indicate high demand in the market, while a higher DOM could suggest less demand or overpricing.

# Occupancy Rate:
For rental properties, the occupancy rate reflects the percentage of units that are currently rented. A higher occupancy rate generally indicates a more stable income stream.
